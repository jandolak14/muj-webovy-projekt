# Hugo Start

A simple hugo boilerplate showing some of Hugo's functionality.


## Quick Start

- Download [latest release](rel) and unzip into your working directory. 
- Rename the folder as you want.
- Navigate to this folder in your command line (PowerShell in Windows, Terminal in macOS or Linux).
- Run `hugo server`. 
- Hugo should return several messages (see code below). There is an address that allows opening the website in your browser: below it's `http://localhost:1313/hugo-start/`.

```
$ hugo server

                   | EN

## Best Practice

When adding small changes, do not commit anything from `/docs folder`. Push changes in docs only after some milestone, preferably by a single user, so that merge conflicts do not make work with the repository difficult.

Generally, built files are not to be commited exactly for this reason â€” but in this case, they're useful to generate a [Github Sites based website](http://jan-martinek.github.io/hugo-start/).


## Troubleshooting

- When running `hugo new`, this error is shown: **Unable to locate Config file. Perhaps you need to create a new site.** You're in a wrong folder.
- When running any comman, this error is shown: **command not found: hugo**. Hugo is not installed correctly. Either reinstall Hugo or check whether you typed it correctly.
