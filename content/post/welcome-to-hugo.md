Youâ€™ll find this post in your `content/post` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run command `hugo server`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/post` directory that follows the convention `name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. You can even create it with command `hugo new post/name-of-post.md` (you need to be at site's root folder). Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

When you want to publish an article, simply remove `draft: true` from it's front matter.
